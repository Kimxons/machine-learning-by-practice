Practice machine learning with projects* 

Use a Structured Step-by-step process
• Any predictive modeling machine learning project can be broken
down into six common tasks:
• 1. Define Problem.
• 2. Summarize Data.
• 3. Prepare Data.
• 4. Evaluate Algorithms.
• 5. Improve Results.
• 6. Present Results.

Tasks can be combined or broken down further, but this is the general structure
